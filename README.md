# shapes-demo
A simple demonstration showing an interaction between 2d shapes. Written for a developmental psychology class project.

**Controls**
* A and D to move the left rectangle
* left and right arrow keys to move the center rectangle
* J and L to move the right rectangle

**Disclaimer:** My collision detection is *very* buggy and hacky since I wrote this on limited time. I'm also new to JavaScript and game dev concepts in general so I apologize for the messy code! It works well enough for a short class presentation which was my goal.
