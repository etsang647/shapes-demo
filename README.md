# shapes-demo
An interactive platforming demo involving shapes based on [this study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288) on infant morality by Hamlin et al., 2007. I was inspired by the animations they used to test [infants' preferences](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288/figures/1) in various social situations and wrote this program as a creative project for my developmental psychology class.

**Controls**
* A and D to move the left rectangle
* left and right arrow keys to move the center rectangle
* J and L to move the right rectangle

**Disclaimer:** My collision detection is *very* buggy and hacky since I wrote this on limited time. I'm also new to JavaScript and game dev concepts in general so I apologize for the messy code! It works well enough for a short class presentation which was my goal.
