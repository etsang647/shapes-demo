# shapes-demo
A simple demonstration showing an interaction between 2d shapes. Written for a developmental psychology class project.

**Disclaimer:** My collision detection is *very* buggy and hacky since I wrote this on limited time. I'm also new to JavaScript and game dev concepts so I apologize for the messy code! At least it works well enough for a short class presentation.
