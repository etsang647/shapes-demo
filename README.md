# shapes-demo
A simple demonstration showing an interaction between 2d shapes. Written for a developmental psychology class project.

Disclaimer: My collision detection is *very* buggy and hacky as I am a complete newb to game dev and wrote this on limited time. At least it works well enough for a class presentation which was my goal.
